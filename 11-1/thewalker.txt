Target Distance: 10, Step Size: 5
0: (x,y) = (-4.87185,1.12476)

1: (x,y) = (0.11597,1.47354)

2: (x,y) = (4.21173,-1.39434)

3: (x,y) = (9.15017,-2.17652)

4: (x,y) = (12.4305,-5.95006)

After 5 steps,the subject has the following location:
(x,y) = (12.4305,-5.95006)
or
(mag,ang) = (13.7811,-0.446437)
